No, Java does not allow you to do this. Because duplicate method DigitalVideoDisc(String) in type DigitalVideoDisc, this is an error that when you pass 1 String to Java, it don't know it belong to title or category. To fix this, you can create a constructor method to build a DVD by title and category (This is known as constructor overloading).
